This can be solved using greedy algorithm,consider how much profit is made each day and decide whether to sell of buy that day
if profit is negative add 0 to maxProfit else add daily profit to maxProfit
     
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        maxProfit = 0
        temp = float("-inf")
        cost = float("inf")
        for price in prices:
            dailyProfit = price - cost
            if dailyProfit < 0:
                maxProfit += 0
                cost = price
            else:
                maxProfit += dailyProfit
                cost = price
        return maxProfit
