This is has a blend of dynamic programming and greedy algorithm. 
Find the optimal cost to get to each postion on the stair case return the min cost of the between the last 2 steps.

class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        for i in range(2, len(cost)):
            cost[i] = min(cost[i-1]+cost[i], cost[i-2]+cost[i])
        return min(cost[len(cost) - 1], cost[len(cost)-2])
